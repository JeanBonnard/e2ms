JSCS plugin to include errors for features that are deprecated in Ember.js\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\nnpm install jscs-ember-deprecations --save-dev\n```\n\nYou'll also need to tell JSCS to load the plugin. Modify your `.jscsrc` file to include\n\n```json\n\"plugins\": [\n  \"jscs-ember-deprecations\"\n],\n\"disallowObjectController\": true,\n\"disallowInstanceInInitializer\": true,\n\"disallowPrototypeExtension\": true,\n\"disallowAtEachLeafNode\": true,\n// ...\n```\n\nIf you invoke JSCS with `--fix` (see http://jscs.info/overview#cli) some deprecation errors can be fixed automatically.\n\nSee [Supported deprecations](#supported-deprecations) for valid keys\n\n## Why\n\nMigrating to a newer Ember version can be tricky if you haven't already gone back and removed all uses of deprecated features. Instead, this plugin intends to enable a migration path in a codebase, where developers can be warned when they use deprecated features.\n\nA sample use case is to:\n\n- Use a tool like [Lint Review](https://github.com/markstory/lint-review) to automagically annotate pull requests. Developers will be warned if they're using a feature that is deprecated. Put these \"aspirational\" rules in `.toolbot_jscsrc`\n- Use `broccoli-jscs` so that JSCS gets run at the same time you're running unit tests. Put rules that are \"mandatory\" in your codebase's `.jscsrc`. Any violations of those rules will result in the test suite failing.\n\nThis way a codebase can be gradually brought into compliance over time.\n\n## Supported deprecations\n\n### Deprecations added in Ember 1.11\n\n- `disallowObjectController` will warn you if you use the deprecated `Ember.ObjectController`. See http://emberjs.com/deprecations/v1.x/#toc_objectcontroller for details.\n\n- `disallowInstanceInInitializer` will warn you if you are looking up instances within an initializer. See http://emberjs.com/deprecations/v1.x/#toc_access-to-instances-in-initializers for details.\n\n### Deprecations added in Ember 1.12\n\n- `disallowCoreView` will warn you if you use the deprecated `Ember.CoreView`. See https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/pull/10585 for details.\n\n- `disallowEmberTryCatch` will warn you if you use the deprecated `Ember.tryCatch` or `Ember.tryCatchFinally` helpers. See https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/pull/10667 for details.\n\n- `disallowEmberRequired` will warn you if you use the deprecated `Ember.required()` helper. See https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/pull/10668 for details.\n\n- `disallowDualGetterSetter` will warn you if you use a dual setter/getter function argument to `Ember.computed()`. See http://emberjs.com/deprecations/v1.x/#toc_computed-properties-with-a-shared-getter-and-setter for details.\n\n### Deprecations added in Ember 1.13\n\n- `disallowAtEachLeafNode` will warn you if you use the deprecated `foo.@each` notation. See https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/pull/11994 for details.\n\n- `disallowArrayComputed` will warn you if you use the deprecated `Ember.ArrayComputedProperty` or `Ember.arrayComputed()`. See https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/pull/11403 for details.\n\n- `disallowReduceComputed` will warn you if you use the deprecated `Ember.ReduceComputedProperty` or `Ember.reduceComputed()`. See https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/pull/11403 for details.\n\n- `disallowEmberCreate` will warn you if you use the deprecated `Ember.create()` function.
