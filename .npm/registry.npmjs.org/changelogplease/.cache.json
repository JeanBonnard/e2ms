Changelog, please\n\nGenerate changelogs from git commit messages using node.js. The generated changelogs are written in markdown.\n\nSupport this project by [donating on Gittip](https://www.gittip.com/scottgonzalez/).\n\n## Installation\n\n```\nnpm install changelogplease\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```javascript\nvar changelog = require( \"changelogplease\" );\nchangelog({\n\tticketUrl: \"https://github.com/scottgonzalez/changelogplease/issues/{id}\",\n\tcommitUrl: \"https://github.com/scottgonzalez/changelogplease/commit/{id}\",\n\trepo: \"/path/to/repo\",\n\tcommittish: \"1.2.3..1.2.4\"\n}, function( error, log ) {\n\tif ( error ) {\n\t\tconsole.log( error );\n\t\treturn;\n\t}\n\n\tconsole.log( log );\n});\n```\n\n## API\n\n### changelog( options, callback )\n\n* `options` (Object): Options for creating the changelog.\n  * `ticketTypes` (Array): Which ticket types to look for when parsing logs. See [`Changelog.ticketParsers`](#changelogticketparsers) for a list of available types. Ticket references are parsed in the order specified. Defaults to `[\"github\"]`.\n  * `ticketUrl` (String or Object): Template(s) for ticket/issue URLs; `{id}` will be replaced with the ticket ID. When specifying multiple values for `ticketTypes`, `ticketUrl` must be an object with the ticket type as the keys and the URL templates as the values.\n  * `commitUrl (String)`: Template for commit URLs; `{id}` will be replaced with the commit hash.\n  * `repo` (String): Path to the repository.\n  * `committish` (String): The range of commits for the changelog.\n  * `sort` (Boolean, Function): Function for sorting commits. By default commits are sorted alphabetically so they are grouped by component. A value of `false` disables sorting.\n* `callback` (Function; `function( error, log )`): Function to invoke after generating the changelog.\n  * `log` (String): Generated changelog, written in markdown.\n\n### Changelog\n\n`changelog( options, callback )` is a shorthand for the following:\n\n```js\nvar Changelog = require( \"changelogplease\" ).Changelog;\nvar instance = new Changelog( options );\ninstance.parse( callback );\n```\n\nChangelog generation is tailored to a specific format based on the needs of the various jQuery\nprojects. However, the `Changelog` constructor and prototype are exposed to allow flexibility.\nBe aware that these methods are not currently documented because they may change. Feel free to\nsubmit [feature requests](https://github.com/scottgonzalez/changelogplease/issues/new) if you don't\nfeel comfortable hacking in your own changes (or even if you do).\n\n### Changelog.ticketParsers\n\nChangelogplease supports multiple issue trackers. `Changelog.ticketParsers` defines the list of supported ticket types and allows user-defined parsers to be added.\n\n#### Built-in parsers\n\n* github: The github parser supports all forms of GitHub issue references: `#123`, `gh-123`, and `account/repo#123`. Because GitHub supports the short form `#123`, this parser can be used for other issue trackers as well.\n* jira: JIRA issues must be in the form `PROJECT-123`, with the project reference in all caps.\n\n#### Custom parsers\n\nCustom parsers can be implemented by adding a new property to `Changelog.ticketParsers`. The key is the name of the parser and the value is a function which receives two parameters:\n\n* `commit` (String): The full commit message.\n* `ticketUrl` (Function; `function( ticketId )`): A function which accepts a ticket ID and returns the URL for the specified ticket.\n\nThe function must return an array of objects each containing two values:\n\n* `url`: The URL for the ticket (generated by invoking the `ticketUrl` method).\n* `label`: The label for the ticket.\n\n## License\n\nCopyright Scott González.
