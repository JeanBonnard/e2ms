run-when-changed\n\n[![GratiPay](https://img.shields.io/gratipay/user/alexgorbatchev.svg)](https://gratipay.com/alexgorbatchev/)\n![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/run-when-changed.svg)\n![Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/run-when-changed.svg)\n\nSelectively executes commands when watched files are changed (Nix & Win32).\n\n## Installation\n\n```\nnpm install --save-dev run-when-changed\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```\nUsage: run-when-changed --watch <glob> --match [glob] --exec <cmd> (--watch <glob> --match [glob] --exec <cmd>)\n\nSelectively executes commands when watched files are changed.\n\nOptions:\n\n  -h, --help          output usage information\n  -w, --watch <glob>  A glob to watch, starts a new group\n  -e, --exec <cmd>    Command to execute, eg \"echo %s\"\n  -m, --match [glob]  Only files that match will be executed\n  --verbose           Verbose mode\n```\n\n## CMD format\n\nCommand line accepts the following tokens:\n\n* `%filedir` - Changed file directory, relative to CWD.\n* `%filename` - Changed file name and extension.\n* `%filepath` - Changed file directory, file name and extension relative to CWD.\n* `%s` - Same as `%filepath`.\n* `%package-json-dir` - Full path to nearest folder that contains `package.json`.\n* `%full-filedir` - Full absolute changed file directory.\n* `%full-filepath` - Full absolute changed file directory, file name and extension.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Watching one or more glob\n\n```\n$ run-when-changed --watch \"**/*.js\" --exec \"ls -la %s\"\n$ run-when-changed --watch \"**/*.js\" --watch \"README.md\" --exec \"ls -la %s\"\n```\n\n### Executing multiple commands\n\nHaving more than one `exec` passed per `watch` will execute multiple commands per file when there's a change event.\n\n```\n$ run-when-changed --watch \"**/*.js\" --exec \"ls -la %s\" --exec \"chmod +x %s\"\n```\n\n### Watching multiple globs\n\nYou can `watch` multiple globs and execute commands specific to each glob.\n\n```\n$ run-when-changed \\\n  --watch \"**/*.js\" --exec \"ls -la %s\" \\  # executes `ls` for `*.js` files\n  --watch \"**/*.txt\" --exec \"rm %s\" \\     # executes `rm` for `*.txt` files\n```\n\n### Filtering\n\n```\n# executes `ls` for `*-test.js` files\n$ run-when-changed --watch \"**/*.js\" --filter \"*-test.js\" --exec \"ls -la %s\"\n```\n\n### Running mocha\n\nThis command will execute `mocha` test runner for all `tests/**/*-test.js` files.\n\n```\n$ run-when-changed \\\n  --watch \"tests/**/*-test.js\" \\\n  --exec \"mocha --require babel-register %s\" \\\n  --verbose\n```\n\n## NPM Package Usage Examples\n\nInstall locally (`npm install --save-dev run-when-changed`) then add the following to your `package.json`\n\n### Mocha\n\nYou can use `npm run dev` command to start a file watcher that will execute the test file you are working on without having to add `.only`.\n\n```js\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"run-when-changed --watch 'tests/**/*-test.js' --exec 'mocha --require babel-register %s'\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Mocha & Babel\n\nYou can use `npm run dev` command to start a file watcher that will execute the test file you are working on without having to add `.only` and compile `*.js` files in the root folder using Babel.js.\n\n```js\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"dev\": \"run-when-changed.js --watch 'tests/**/*-test.js' --exec 'mocha --require babel-register %s' --watch '*.js' --exec 'babel %s --out-dir ./lib --source-maps'\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Notes\n\n1. `filter` and `exec` applies only to immediately preceeding `watch`\n1.
